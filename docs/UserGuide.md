   Some example commands you can try:

  * **`list`** : Lists all job applicants, along with an overview of each applicant.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [s/SKILLS]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/Python` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[s/SKILLS]…​` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `s/Python`, `s/Python s/Java` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

  e.g If there are only `4` applicants in the app but `5` is specified, then the intended action will not be carried out.
* Only positive indexes are edited. <br>
  e.g As we label our applicants starting from `1...`, an index of `-1` will not be tagged to an applicant.

<br>

Example:
```

### Flagging an applicant : `flag`

Allows you to flag an applicant identified by the index number. The index number used corresponds to the one in the displayed applicant list. Flagged applicants will appear at the top of the list and are identified with a flag symbol.

<br>

Format:
```
flag INDEX
```

* Only valid indexes are flagged. <br>
  e.g If there are only `4` applicants in the app but `5` is specified, then the intended action will not be carried out.
* Only positive indexes are flagged. <br>
  e.g As we label our applicants starting from `1...`, an index of `-1` will not be tagged to an applicant.
* Flag acts like a toggle. To un-flag the applicant, you may simply re-type the same command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Try flagging the first applicant by typing `flag 1`. You should see it at the top with a flag symbol. Then try un-flagging the same applicant with `flag 1`.
</div>

<br>

Example:
```
flag 1
```
Sample Output:
```
Flagged Applicant: David Lee; 
Phone: 91234567; 
Email: johndoe@example.com; 
Job: Risk Assessment Associate; 
Round: Stock Pitch Assessment; 
Skills: [Accounting][Equities][Cryptocurrency]
```
<br>

```

Extended Sample Output for unflagging:

Phone: 91234567; 
Email: johndoe@example.com; 
Job: Risk Assessment Associate; 
Round: Stock Pitch Assessment; 
Skills: [Accounting][Equities][Cryptocurrency]
```

<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Flag Command Interaction with Other Commands:**

* Index of applicant to be flagged/unflagged always follows the index indicated on the user interface. <br>
e.g After executing a search, sort or view command, `flag 1` still flags/unflags the applicant at the top of the list. 
* A flagged applicant acts like a pinned email, and will always be located at the top of the applicant list,
except after search and view commands. <br>
  In that case, flagged applicants will be displayed according to the command's sorting order,
  and will no longer be displayed at the top.
  * E.g After a sort command, the no longer be displayed at the top of the list and will be displayed according to the order 
  specified in the sort command. 
  * E.g After a search command, flagged applicants will be displayed in order of which applicants most satisfy the search conditions.
